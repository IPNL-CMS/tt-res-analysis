/**
 * \class TTSemilepRecoRochester
 * \brief Reconstructs semileptonic tt decays following the Rochester algorithm
 * 
 * Reconstruction of the neutrino is delegated to class NuRecoRochester, which exploits constraints
 * from masses of the top quark and the W boson. Each event interpretation is ranked using a
 * (logarithm of the) product of two likelihood functions. One describes distribution of the
 * figure of merit used in the neutrino reconstruction, the other one represents the joint
 * distribution of the two reconstructed masses.
 * 
 * By default, all possible jet assignments are considered. User can specify a selection on b tags
 * of jets matched to b quarks.
 * 
 * A version of this algorithm was used in TOP-16-008 (AN-16-020).
