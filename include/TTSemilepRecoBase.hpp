/**
 * \class TTSemilepRecoBase
 * \brief An abstract base class to perform jet assignment in a semileptonic ttbar event
 * 
 * This is a base class for a plugin to identify reconstructed jets corresponding to the four
 * quarks in the final state of tt -> blv bqq. The plugin implements looping over all possible ways
 * to assign four reconstructed jets to the four quarks, or interpretations. A derived class must
 * implement method to compute the rank of an interpretation. The plugin accepts interpretation
 * that gets the highest rank.
 * 
 * Reconstruction of the neutrino is delegated to the derived class. If multiple candidates can
 * be reconstructed in a single event, it must choose the most suitable one. It provides
 * reconstructed neutrino and also selected charged lepton by implementing pure virtual methods
 * GetLepton and GetNeutrino.
 * 
 * No reconstruction is performed if an event contains less than four jets satisfying the
 * selection. However, this plugin never rejects events.
 * 
 * This plugin relies on a jet reader with the default name "JetMET".
