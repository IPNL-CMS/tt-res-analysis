 * `TTRecoLikelihood_v1.root` <br />
   Likelihood functions for reconstruction of tt -> blv bqq following the Rochester algorithm. Created with the setup for 2015 data. This is a pruned version of a file sent by Mauro Verzetti on 22.07.2016.
 * `TTRecoLikelihood_2016v1.root` <br />
   Likelihood functions for tt reconstruction following the Rochester algorithm. Jet pt threshold is 30 GeV. Adapted from a file released by Mauro on 03.10.2016.
 * `TTRecoLikelihood_2016-pt20-v1.root` <br />
   Likelihood functions for tt reconstruction following the Rochester algorithm. Jet pt threshold is 20 GeV. Adapted from a [file](http://home.fnal.gov/~verzetti/htt_perm_baseline_j20.root) released by Mauro on 10.11.2016.
