# Searches for tt resonances

This is a collection of plugins for [PECFwk](https://github.com/andrey-popov/PECLocalFwk), which are intended to be used in searches for tt resonances.

This repository is in the initial stage of development and thus is likely to undergo significant reorganizations in future.
